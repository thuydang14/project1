I want to investigate about potential Loan in prosper Loan Data and find answer for questions below:

1. What is relation between loan status and debt per income ratio?

2. How is the relation between loan status, borrow status, debt per income and verifiable income?

3. How is the relation between loan status, borrow status, debt per income and total prosper loans?
